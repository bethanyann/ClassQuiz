<?php

class Answer {
    //put your code here
    
//$hotelsdetail = array();    
//$hotelsdetail[] = new hoteldetails();

//This will append the object to the end of the array.

//$hotelsdetail = array();    
//$hotelsdetail[] = new hoteldetails();
//$hotelsdetail[] = new hoteldetails();
//$hotelsdetail[] = new hoteldetails();

//This would create an array with three objects, appending each one successively.
